						Hi.<br> 
						I'm Gundu Vinod Kumar studying B.Arch in Nit Trichy. I have this
						confusion in my 1st year on deciding what network should I
						choose as I don't know which is the best network provider in Tamil
						Nadu. I don't like to change my phone number again.
						So I have to choose the right network.

						Many people like me are facing this same problem and also many queries
						related to networks.
						This website is started to clear all those confusions.

						The best network or best plans are decided not by the website but by
						many users of this network through likes,ratings and comments in terms
						of network coverage, plans, customer support.

						<br>
						<b>Note: These rankings are based on ratings of the users. </b>
						<br/><br/>

						So it helps best 
						<br><br>
						<h4>For network providers:</h4>					
						<ul>
							<li>
									They can know clearly in which part they are bad or good, so that they could change that.
							</li>
							<li>
								They can know their pros and cons by the ratings and comments of those plans, as the comments are categorised by likes so that they can can read top comments.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<br>

						<h4>For users:</h4>

						<ul>
							<li>They could find the best network which exactly suits their needs</li>
						</ul>
